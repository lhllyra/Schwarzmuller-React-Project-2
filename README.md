# Schwarzmuller-React-Project-2
The code contained here is my resolution to a challenge project proposed by instructor professor Maximillian (Max) Schwarzm√ºller on his "React - The Complete Guide" Course, ministered through the Udemy platform.

In this project, (a simple quiz of React basic knowledge) various topics and react competencies where explored, such as:

- Prop drilling (deep dive)
- Component composition
- Side Effects
- React hooks and tools, such as: Context API (creating, providing and consuming context; Linking Context to state), useReducer(), useEffect() & useEffect cleanUp functions, useCallback().
